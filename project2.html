        This was a very challenging project for me. I had just learnt a bit of
        JavaScript and got into the project right away. I was stuck for a quite
        a while and was hesitant to ask for help from the community. But I had
        built up the courage and asked for help from the community. Everyone was
        very helpful and I was able to complete my project within a couple of
        days.
