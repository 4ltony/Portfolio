        This project acknowledges my understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript

      <p>
        This project was a challenging task for me to see where my HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript knowledge were at. I had low expectations for this project
        and thought it would be plain and boring. But to my surprise, once I
        finished it off, I was very impressed with myself.
